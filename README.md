SNHU CS-350: Emerging Systems Architectures & Technologies

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The final project was to develop a smart thermostat protype using the TI board for SysTec. The temperature sensor was created to read the room temperature (via I2C), the LEDs had to indicate the output to the thermostat where LED on = heat on, and two buttons had to increase and decrease the set temperature using the GPIO interrupt, and the UART sent the data to the server.

What did you do particularly well?

I felt like I did well considering the length of this course and my experience I had coming into this course, which was very little experience. I've never worked with TI boards in the past,but I will say that I learned to really emjoy it. Even if I didn't get an A on every assignment, my interest in continuing to learn is there and I excited to learn more in the future. Zybooks really helped too.

Where could you improve?

My biggest issue through out this course was understanding how everything functioned with the timers, GPIO, and UARTs. I just knew what functions to call for what from previous milestones, but I trouble understanding exactly how they worked.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

This was my first time ever working with an embedded system. I really enjoyed working with the Code Composer IDE, as someone who has experience with Eclipse, it was super easy to learn. Then, the biggest resource that helped me was our ZyBooks book and TI pdfs.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Proper research on how to correctly build certain models and task schedulars. Also, referring to previous work and feedback helps. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

For the Thermostat program, I used most of my recycled code from the past assignments which helped make the final work easy and more adaptable.
